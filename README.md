# Decision_Boundary
This project visualizes the decision boundaries of Logistic Regression and MLP Classifier (Neural Network) to highlight their differences in handling linear vs. non-linear classification problems.

# 🔍 Decision Boundary Visualization: Logistic Regression vs MLP Classifier

This project demonstrates the difference in decision boundaries between a **Logistic Regression model** and a **Neural Network (MLP Classifier)** on a synthetic dataset. It visually explains how linear and non-linear classifiers behave when solving classification problems.

## 📌 Overview

- Logistic Regression: A linear model that performs well on linearly separable data.
- MLP Classifier (Neural Network): A non-linear model capable of learning complex patterns.
- The comparison is visualized using decision boundary plots.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- numpy

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository  
2. Open the notebook (`.ipynb`) in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells to see the data generation and boundary plots

## 🧠 Insights

- Logistic Regression creates a straight-line boundary.
- MLP Classifier adapts to complex shapes in data, ideal for non-linear patterns.
- Visual comparison helps understand model choice for different problems.
